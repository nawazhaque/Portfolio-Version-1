                <p> Hi, my name is Nawaz Haque. I have had a passion for technology and witnessing it's exponential growth since I can remember. Road 2 Hire has allowed me to be able to be apart of the technology industry and I plan on leaving my mark. Being able to learn how to use languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js have been helping me see my future in the tech field. <br>

                  <p>My E-commerce project was filled with hardships and late nights looking over code. I was able to utilize what I was able to learn thus far into the program, and implement it into this website. At this point in R2H, I was confident enough in myself to not stress over this project. As I began tackling it and started to code, I noticed what I  had issues with. This was really helpful as it pointed out direct areas where practice was needed. I overcame most of my hurdles by continuously trying to get to the image I have in my head, and sometimes that meant rewriting blocks of code at a time because I kept breaking my code. There was HTML & CSS with a few effects that we had not learned in class that I threw into the mix, and that showcases the effort that went into this E-commerce project. I attempted doing a slideshow and having more items on the homepage but I was not able to get it working before the due date. Looking back, I would definitely take more time in the planning stage to figure out to a T what I will be coding, along with starting work on my projects as soon as possible. Moving forward, I am proud to have my name on this website and I cannot wait to continue expanding my skills.

                <h2>Road Talk</h2>
                <section class="tile3_content">
                    <img src="images/roadtalk-10-BG.jpg" id="image2">
                  <p class="rtText">I spoke about how gaming is linked to increased cognitive functions in my first roadtalk. I was nervous going into it but I was able to pick a topic that most of my peers participate in. I was the main focus point in my roadtalk, I chose not to do a kahoot or something to “buy some time”. This was to push myself to hitting the time limit on my own, while still encapsulating the audience. As part of roadtalks, we received feedback and I was told I made use of no filler words, and I came off as really confident and knowledgeable on my subject. Which is amazing, because up until this point in the program I had spoken out in class maybe a handful of times. I was also told that I stumble over a few words, and that it may be due to myself speaking at a slightly faster pace than I should be. This can lead to the audience not being able to digest the information I am giving them. I went on to host Roadtalk #10, instead of doing speeches per se I was still speaking for a portion of the Roadtalk. I was able to find my pace (vocally) and deliver any lines I had with confidence and clearness. As I progress in the program, I need to sharpen my public speaking skills in order to be as good as I can be. I want to wow anyone and everyone in the next space(s) I go to. Before I had any professional development, I was not aware of the importance that communicating in an orderly, clear manner has on the work environment.
